## Getting Started and Running the Application
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a new MongoDB Project and Cluster.
3. Add your IP address for access (or select **Allow Access from Anywhere**).
4. Choose the **Drivers** connection method and copy the connection string.
5. Paste it into your `.env` file as `MONGODB_URL`, replacing `<db_password>` with your database userâ€™s password.
6. Generate a JWT secret:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
   ```
   Copy the output into your `.env` file as `JWT_SECRET`.
7. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables
Your `.env` file should look like this:
```env
MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<db_password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/worksy
JWT_SECRET=<your_generated_secret>
PORT=5000
```
You should replace <username> and <db_password> with your own username and database password respectively.

## Testing

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
2. To run frontend tests:
